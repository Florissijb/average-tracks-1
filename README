R script to make an "average" track of several GPS tracks by combining/merging
them into a "line of best fit". Made by Michiel Faber
<http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Michiel%20Faber> and wrapped and "packaged" by Guttorm Flatabø.
This isn’t the perfect way to do it, but it works.

TopoFusion software uses a more sophisticated method and have written a paper about it
<http://www.topofusion.com/network.php>. The issue has also been discussed on the gpsbabel-misc mailing list 
<http://goo.gl/HJE5s>.
