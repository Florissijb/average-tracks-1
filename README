R script to make an "average" track of several GPS tracks by combining/merging
them into a "line of best fit". Based on the work of Michiel Faber
<http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Michiel%20Faber> who has made an R script
and posted Dutch language instructions on how to use it, in the OpenStreetMap
forums <http://forum.openstreetmap.org/viewtopic.php?id=11202>. Michiel has
noted that this isnâ€™t the perfect way to do it, but that it works for him.
He points to the TopoFusion software and a paper they have written for a more
sophisticated method <http://www.topofusion.com/network.php>. The issue has
also been discussed on the gpsbabel-misc mailing list.
